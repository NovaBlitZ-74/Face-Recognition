# Face-Recognition
Only uploaded the main 3 code files
Except this the virtual environment file should be present with the respective dependencies such as opencv, face-recognition, etc.
And there should be a seperate folder containing photos of the face to be recognised
I had the photos of elon musk, bill gates, etc theredore i used them to make the model.
